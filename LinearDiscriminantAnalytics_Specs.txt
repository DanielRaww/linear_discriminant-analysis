##Place a command to remove all variables from your environment at the very beginning of your script 
##Do not include the following commands in your code: install.packages, view or fix commands, and commands resetting your working directory in your final code. 
##Do include libraries you used in your code.
##Ensure you are able to run your code from start to finish without changing place in your code. 

##Load the mlbench library along with other libraries you need to solve this problem. 
##Load the Glass dataset out of the mlbench library and add commands to get to know the dataset. 
##Model 1: LDA
##Set the seed to 123 
##Set Data Partition to subset 75% of the data for the train group and 25% for the test group.  
##Use the preprocess function to center and scale your data and execute on both train and test datasets. 
##Make an lda model with the training dataset that you just transformed using Type as the dependent variable (Y). Print that model to see initial results. 
##Graph at least 3 of the combinations of LD's using ggplot2, setting the color to Type. 
##Make predictions with the ldamodel using the transformed test data.
##Calculate the accuracy rate and produce a confusion matrix using the table function. 
##Answer the following questions: 1) What is the accuracy rate?
##2) Where did you misclassify observations?
##Use the plot function to plot the ldamodel combinations.
###Model 2: QDA
###Check to see if a qda model can be calculated. If so, calculate it. If not, state why in comments. 

##After you finish writing your code and editing your file, submit your .R file directly to gradescope.
